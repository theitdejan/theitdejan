### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dejan. I'm a software engineer with little less than 10 years of experience. Most of the work I've done is privately-repoed closed-source code, but I also contributed to some of the open source libs.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a complex full-stack project for a F500 company.
- ðŸŒ± My preferred tech stack: Java / Kotlin, Spring, AWS, Microservice Architecture, Apache Kafka, TypeScript, React.js.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
